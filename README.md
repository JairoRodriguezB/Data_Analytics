**Exploratory Data Analysis - TikTok**
Code: EDA_TikTok.ipynb

Goal: To uncover patterns and insights within TikTok-related data, focusing on understanding the dataset's structure and key characteristics.

Description:
The project involves analyzing a TikTok dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analysis begins with data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing. Exploratory techniques are applied to summarize and visualize the data, followed by a deeper statistical analysis to identify patterns. Specific steps include handling duplicates, analyzing feature distributions, identifying correlations, and investigating relationships between key variables such as engagement rates, video views, and post timings.

Skills: Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, trend visualization, data preprocessing.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Results:
The analysis highlighted key trends, such as the correlation between post timings and engagement rates, revealing actionable insights for optimizing content strategies. Additionally, engagement rates were found to vary significantly across video durations, providing valuable data-driven recommendations.
