# Currently under development 
This section showcases my data analytics projects, emphasizing the practical application of data science techniques to address real-world problems. Each project highlights the specific technology stack, methodologies, and approaches used to extract insights, validate hypotheses, and develop predictive models.

**Exploratory Data Analysis - TikTok**

The project involves analyzing a TikTok dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analysis begins with data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing. Exploratory techniques are applied to summarize and visualize the data, followed by a deeper statistical analysis to identify patterns. Specific steps include handling duplicates, analyzing feature distributions, identifying correlations, and investigating relationships between key variables such as engagement rates, video views, and post timings.

- Code: EDA_TikTok.ipynb

- Goal: To uncover patterns and insights within TikTok-related data, focusing on understanding the dataset's structure and key characteristics.

- Skills: Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, trend visualization, data preprocessing.

- Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

- Results: The analysis highlighted key trends, such as the correlation between post timings and engagement rates, revealing actionable insights for optimizing content strategies. Additionally, engagement rates were found to vary significantly across video durations, providing valuable data-driven recommendations.


**A/B Testing - Automatidata**

The project focuses on analyzing taxi trip data to evaluate key relationships and differences in trip and payment characteristics through A/B testing. The process includes loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the data, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize and visualize distributions. Statistical hypothesis testing is applied to compare groups and uncover significant patterns, ensuring assumptions like normality and variance homogeneity are met.

- Code: AB_testing_Automatidata.ipynb

- Goal: To identify statistically significant differences between groups in taxi trip data, providing actionable insights into payment trends and trip characteristics.

- Skills: Data cleaning, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, data visualization, assumption validation.

- Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

- Results: The analysis revealed meaningful differences between groups, supported by statistical tests, and provided insights into key trip metrics. Visualization of distributions and hypothesis testing outcomes highlighted actionable trends for decision-making.
